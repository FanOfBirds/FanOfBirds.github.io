  <h1>Backyard Birds of Anchorage</h1>
    <div id="introduction">
      <p>Have you ever wondered what the cute little birds hopping around your backyard are? Perhaps you got a bird feeder and noticed some new feathered visitors and didn't know what they were. You're in luck! Here is a little guide to the birds you will find in your backyard if you live in <span><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorage,_Alaska" target="_blank">the Anchorage area</a></strong></span>.</p>

  <div id="chickadees">
    <h3>Chickadees</h3>
      <img src="BlackcappedChickadee.jpg" alt="A Black-Capped Chickadee viewed from the side." width="300" height="200">
      <img src="BorealChickadee.webp" alt="A Boreal Chickadee with its head tilted upwards showing off its unique brown and ruddy coloration." width="300" height="200">
        <p>You have probably seen and heard chickadees before. Chickadees travel in family groups and can be observed hopping around on trees catching insects. There are two kinds of chickadees you will see in Anchorage. The more common one is a Black-Capped Chickadee, pictured on the left above. The other is called a Boreal Chickadee and they can generally be identified by the lower contrast of their colors. Sometimes the two species can be observed travelling in mixed groups, so make sure to look closely at chickadee flocks!</p>

  <div id="nuthatch">
    <h3>Nuthatch</h3>
      <img src="RedBreastedNuthatch.jpg" alt="A Red Breasted Nuthatch standing on a branch looking sideways into the camera" width="300" height="200">
        <p>The only nuthatch you will observe in your backyard in Anchorage is a Red Breasted Nuthatch. They are especially skilled at hopping quickly up and down vertical tree trunks. The eye stripe and distinct orange color are vital in identifying them if you haven't learned their single beep-like note yet!</p>
  </div>
  <div id="thrushes">
    <h3>Thrushes</h3>
      <img src="AmericanRobin.jpg" alt="An American Robin standing at the top of a branch, its feathers have been ruffled by wind." width="300" height="200">
      <img src="VariedThrush.jpg" alt="A Varied Thrush standing on a thin branch at an angle to see its bright orange belly" width="300" height="200">
        <p>The thrush we all know is the American Robin (left), which is not, in fact, a robin. It is the same type of bird as the uncommon Varied Thrush. This bright orange bird with striking black patterns has a chance to visit your yard to sing from a tall tree.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="woodpeckers">
    <h3>Woodpeckers</h3>
      <img src="ThreeToedWoodpecker.jpg" alt="A female Three-Toed Woodpecker standing on a verticle tree trunk." width="300" height="200">
      <img src="DownyWoodpecker.jpg" alt="A Downy Woodpecker clinging onto a thin vertical branch." width="300" height="200">
      <img src="HairyWoodpecker.jpg" alt="A Hairy Woodpecker standing on a veritcal tree trunk." width="200" height="200">
        <p>Consider yourself lucky if you have a woodpecker visit your yard! There are three kinds of woodpeckers you could observe. From left to right, the Three-Toed Woodpecker, the Downy Woodpecker, and the Hairy Woodpecker. Three-toed woodpeckers are easily distinguished from the other two by the barring on its belly. Males have a bit of yellow on their heads in breeding season. The best way to tell the Downy and Hairy Woodpeckers apart is by size. Downy Woodpeckers are much smaller than Hairy Woodpeckers. Both frequent suet feeders in the winter time, which is a good opportunity to see the size difference.</p>
    <!-- While fact-checking I found a cool comparison by Fish and Game of all the woodpeckers so I'll put that here. -->

    <div id="corvids">
      <h3>Corvids</h3>
        <img src="BlackBilledMagpie.jpg" alt="A Black-Billed Magpie standing on a fence post leaning forward" width="300" height="200">
        <img src="CommonRaven.webp" alt="A raven standing on rocks at the ocean's edge." width="300" height="200">
          <p>The magpie that lives in Anchorage is called the Black Billed Magpie, pictured on the left. They are very distinct in their shape and coloration. The raven we have is the Common Raven, on the right. You probably won't see crows in Anchorage.</p>
    </div>
  <div id="waxwings">
    <h3>Waxwings</h3>
      <img src="BohemianWaxwings.webp" alt="Two Bohemian Waxwings sitting on a branch with red berries in their beaks" width="300" height="200">
        <p>Large flocks of Bohemian Waxwings frequent backyards when berries in trees are ripe. They make a lot of buzzy noise and will probably hang around a neighborhood, quickly moving from tree to tree. Here is a video showing what to listen for to confirm the flock of birds you are hearing are waxwings.</p>

  </div>
  <div id=redpolls>
    <h3>Redpolls</h3>
      <img src="CommonRedpoll.jpg" alt="A common redpoll standing on a cow parsnip stalk" width="300" height="200">
        <p>Common Redpolls can withstand very harsh winter conditions, making them a year-round bird. They will frequent your feeder in winter in large flocks and can be easily identified by their distinct stripes and reddish feathers on their heads.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="kinglets">
    <h3>Kinglets</h3>
      <img src="RubyCrownedKinglet.jpg" alt="A Ruby-Crowned Kinglet standing in sage brush." width="375" height="200">
      <img src="GoldenCrownedKinglet.jpg" alt="A Golden-Crowned Kinglet standing on a branch." width="275" height="200">
        <p>Ruby-Crowned Kinglets, on the left, are more common visitors to yards and are affectionately known as RICKY's by birders. Golden-Crowned Kinglets are a bit more rare, but both are a cool bird to see. The reliable way to tell them apart is not the crown, as those are very subtle and practically nonexistent in females and in winter. The way to tell them apart is the white around the Ruby-Crowned Kinglet's eye and the stripe that looks like a mustach at the Golden-Crowned Kinglet's beak.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="junco">
    <h3>Junco</h3>
      <img src="Dark-EyedJunco.png" alt="A Dark-Eyed Junco standing on a spruce tree branch." width="300" height="200">
        <p>The Dark-Eyed Junco is the only junco you will find in Anchorage. It is a sparrow, and they can be found flitting around in the lower branches of trees and on the ground, where they nest.</p>
